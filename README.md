### Hi, I'm Patrik ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD student with Wieland Brendel, Ferenc HuszÃ¡r, Matthias Bethge, and Bernhard SchÃ¶lkopf at the IMPRS-IS/ELLIS programs with research interests in 
- Causal representation learning and
- Identifiability


I recently (Sep 2021) started a [blog](https://rpatrik96.github.io/) on causality, check it out! Even more recently (Nov 2022), I started the [The Path to PhD](https://path2phd.substack.com/) newsletter to share my thoughts and the advice I received during my PhD.
